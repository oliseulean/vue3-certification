# Polish your App

# Challenge Description
In this challenge, let's polish up the Movie Rating App with a few more features including:
- The ability to delete movies
- A display of the average rating.
- A display of the total number of movies
- and the ability to edit movies

## Requirements
- Calculate and display the average rating with a computed prop
- Add a button to reset all movie ratings to zero.
- Calculate and display the total number of movies in the list

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

## Example of Finished App

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
