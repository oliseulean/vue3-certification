# Polish your App

# Challenge Description
## Requirements

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

## Example of Finished App

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
